# Documentation

Follow the guides in workflow order:

1. [Data collection](data-collection.md) explains how the checked-in SFT data
   was produced and audited.
2. [SFT](sft.md) trains the first useful shopping agent.
   The current Qwen3.5-2B three-stage results and GRPO handoff are recorded in
   the [2026-09-16 SFT curriculum report](research/2026-09-16-qwen35-2b-sft-curriculum-report.md).
3. [GRPO](grpo.md) improves that model with online environment reward.
4. [Evaluation](evaluation.md) compares baseline, SFT and GRPO fairly.
5. [Final-200 Clean evaluation dataset](evaluation-dataset.md) defines the current
   curated benchmark and its update record.

[Reward v3](reward-v3.md) is the detailed specification shared by collection,
GRPO and evaluation.
